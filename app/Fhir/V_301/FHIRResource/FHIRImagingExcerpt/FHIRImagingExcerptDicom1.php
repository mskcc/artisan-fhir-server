 * A manifest of a set of DICOM Service-Object Pair Instances (SOP Instances).  The referenced SOP Instances (images or other content) are for a single patient, and may be from one or more studies. The referenced SOP Instances have been selected for a purpose, such as quality assurance, conference, or consult. Reflecting that range of purposes, typical ImagingExcerpt resources may include all SOP Instances in a study (perhaps for sharing through a Health Information Exchange); key images from multiple studies (for reference by a referring or treating physician); a multi-frame ultrasound instance ("cine" video clip) and a set of measurements taken from that instance (for inclusion in a teaching file); and so on.
